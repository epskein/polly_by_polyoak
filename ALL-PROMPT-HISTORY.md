- why cant you fix it yourself?

**Prompt:** Initial setup and component import fixes for React project
**Description:** Fixed multiple import errors throughout the codebase, converting default imports to named imports for UI components (Button, Input, Select, DatePicker, TextArea, Switch, Dialog, Label). Major refactoring of component APIs and state management.

## 2024-12-19 22:45:00
**Prompt:** Now ive got this error in my browser console., Please resolve. ProductInventoryManager.tsx:3 Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module '/polly-by-polyoak/src/components/ui/button/Button.tsx' does not provide an export named 'default' (at ProductInventoryManager.tsx:3:8)
**Description:** Fixed remaining default import issue in ProductInventoryManager.tsx by changing `import Button from "../ui/button/Button"` to `import { Button } from "../ui/button/Button"` to use named export syntax.

## 2024-12-19 22:50:00
**Prompt:** Im now still getting a similar error. Please ensure this issue is resolved across the project. UndoButton.tsx:4 Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module '/polly-by-polyoak/src/components/ui/button/Button.tsx' does not provide an export named 'default' (at UndoButton.tsx:4:8)
**Description:** Conducted comprehensive search and fixed all remaining default import issues with Button component in UndoButton.tsx and Buttons.tsx. Also updated Button component usage in Buttons.tsx to use correct variant and size props, removing deprecated startIcon/endIcon props and using className with flex layout for icons instead. Verified other UI components (Badge, Alert, Avatar, Video components) correctly use default exports.

## 2024-12-19 22:55:00
**Prompt:** Im now getting this error: SidebarContext.tsx:21 Uncaught Error: useSidebar must be used within a SidebarProvider at useSidebar (SidebarContext.tsx:21:11) at App (App.tsx:31:26) Please resolve
**Description:** Fixed SidebarContext error by adding SidebarProvider to the provider chain in main.tsx. The useSidebar hook was being called in App.tsx but there was no SidebarProvider wrapping the component. Added SidebarProvider import and wrapped the Router with SidebarProvider. Also removed duplicate BrowserRouter from App.tsx since it's already provided in main.tsx.

**Prompt:** Great the project starts up! However, when opening the main homescreen dashboard, I see this: There seems to be 2 sets of windows/app panels (one nested in the other) giving me 2 sidebars and causing issues with the alignment and performance. Please fix this.
**Description:** Fixed duplicate layout issue caused by nested AppLayouts. The problem was that App.tsx was rendering AppHeader and AppSidebar directly, while also nesting an AppLayout component that rendered them again. Restructured App.tsx to only use Routes and let AppLayout handle the layout components. Also removed duplicate SidebarProvider from AppLayout.tsx since it's already provided in main.tsx. This eliminated the double sidebars and headers, fixing alignment and performance issues. 

## 2024-12-19 23:05:00
**Prompt:** The project now displays correctly, however, I am not prompted to sign in anymore (and neither can I sign out either) and i am unable to access any of the other 'apps' in my project (Quality Lab Job Tracker, Inventory Tracker). Here is the console output for the apps that dont work.: Warning: React does not recognize the `isHeader` prop on a DOM element...
**Description:** Fixed two major issues: 1) Table component error - The isHeader prop was being passed to DOM elements. Fixed by replacing all TableCell components with isHeader prop to use TableHead components instead in RecentOrders.tsx, BasicTableOne.tsx, and AllUsersTable.tsx. Added TableHead imports to these components. 2) Authentication issue - Created ProtectedRoute component to handle authentication guard functionality. Updated App.tsx to wrap protected routes with ProtectedRoute component which redirects to sign-in when not authenticated. Fixed UserDropdown sign-out navigation path from "/signin" to "/auth/signin" to match the correct route structure. 

## 2024-12-19 23:10:00
**Prompt:** Great the authentication now work again as it should, however, I am still not able to access the Quality Lab Job Tracker-module or the Inventory Tracker-module in my project. I just simply get 404 not found errors. Please fix this
**Description:** Resolved 404 Not Found errors for Quality Lab Job Tracker and Inventory Tracker modules. The issue was a mismatch between the link paths in AppSidebar.tsx and the route paths defined in App.tsx. I corrected the 'path' for 'Inventory Tracker' to '/inventory' and for 'Quality Lab Job Tracker' to '/quality-lab' in the navItems array in AppSidebar.tsx to match the application's routing configuration. This ensures that the sidebar links now correctly navigate to the intended routes.
